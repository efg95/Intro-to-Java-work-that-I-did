Created a die class separate from P71 and P72

P71, does what it says it does and that is bracket all similar values that were rolled by the die.

P72 brackets the largest run of equivalent values, and if there are equivalent runs lengths, brackets the first run.
P72, will not print any brackets if there are no similar runs.
